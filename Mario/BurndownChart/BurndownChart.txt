Burndown Chart


In our burndown chart, since there is a person dropped from our group, we have to rebuild our VSTS and 
make a new project for sprint 3 and our future works. Therefore, our burndown chart looks not so normal: all
our task seems to be build at one day and being done by one or two day near the due date.
But our ture schedule is not like that.
We arrange a meeting right after the sprint 3 assigned date and we work together to make all the task. Then,
after picking our own task, we uploaded and talked about our work during days everyday and went to office 
for help. Our time for implementation is well-scheduled and we are even able to get ahead and make the first
implementaion done one day eariler than due day and start changing codes based on the code quality.
On the refactory, we spend most of the time fixing warnings and making our class cleaner, we all get our 
own work and we are able to merge our work before the due date.
I really think this is a great start. If we keep following the schedule like this, we will be able to meet every 
due date and have spare time for improving our code.
