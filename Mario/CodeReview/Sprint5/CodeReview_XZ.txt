Sprint 5
File: CollisionHandlerFractory.cs
(On the CollisionHandlerFractory Branch )

Comments on Code Quality:
-The way is effcient, it make the files be good to read and reduce the running time.
-The way to handle the collision response is easy to read and not too much complex.
-The way of the internal class looks decent and easy to handle. 

Suggestions:
-There still exist some problem inside the game.
-They way to use delegate maybe is not a good way to go.
-I think the class is too long, if it is possible, it can sperate into several classes.

This is the refractory part for the mario game. we want to create a new version of Collision, so that is why we missed 
something on the sprint. We are still working on that and we will make up what we left on refractory.
