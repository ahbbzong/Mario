(On the CollisionHandlerFractory Branch )

Comments on Code Readablilty:
-The name of the each method is readable and easy to know. 
-The internal class name is easy to understand, we can easily to find the purpose.
-The interaction method toward two object collision is good to read.
Suggestions:
-The naming pattern should be consist, use Carmel or Pascal pattern
-The name as parameter on the line 41 colhandler should be collisionhandler. 
-On line 356, the null pointer operation should be NonePointerOperation should be better.

The Overall of the readibablity looks not bad, only some tiny problem on that.I think there should be some changes for 
the name that make the readibality be better.

This is the refractory part for the mario game. we want to create a new version of Collision, so that is why we missed 
something on the sprint. We are still working on that and we will make up what we left on refractory.
