Specific comments on code quality:
Naming: Good
- The terms are straightforward and they are easy to understand what they stand for. For that reason, It is
easy to understand each field is what does in the class.

Explaining and doing what the class should do: Good
- The class works for output the text on the top of the screen with the infromation in Mario. The logic in drawing
is similar with the draw method in the sprite class. In addition, the fix text controls the lenght of the text
considering the space in the screen by using loop.The tiny recommendation for the the class is that, since the logic 
in draw method is repetitive, put declaration part upward together and put draw process downward together in the signle method would help increase the 
readability.
